# RPGTEXT
A project of a RPG TEXT BASED GAME that I'm including some mechanics/logic that Im testing and probably will reuse if I do it a 2D or 3D MMORPG/RPG


              --Controls--

-Up Arrow
-Down Arrow
-Left Arrow
-Right Arrow
-Enter

How the input works in the program is available in GAME/MENUS/rpgtext_menu.c in the keyregistration() function.
